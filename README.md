# bulk-add-alt-woocommerce
Easily adds the product name to the ALT tag of images associated with WooCommerce products that don't have one (or have a value of less than 10 characters)

When you run an e-commerce shop on WordPress with WooCommerce, it's not uncommon for images associated with products to lack an alternative tag (ALT).

Most of the plugins that allow you to fill in the ALT tags are premium plugins, so here's a free plugin that automatically inserts the name of the product attached to an image in its ALT tag if the tag is empty or less than 10 characters long.

The plugin adds a "Bulk add ALT" submenu to the media menu.

It's very simple, with two buttons for checking whether there are any images attached to your products that don't have an ALT tag, and then correcting this.

Use the "Check images" button to check whether any images are affected by the treatment.

Use the "Fix images" button to correct them.
